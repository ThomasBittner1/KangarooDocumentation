## Spines, Cables, Tails, Straps, Pony Tails...

The **Spine Limb** is probably the most multifunctional limb.
While we use it - as the name suggests - we also use it every time we have a simple FK chain.

### Blueprints
There's 2 attributes - the *blueprint joint count* and the *blueprint joint count*.   
It's best to start with setting them the same value, so you can control where which joint is.
But there's 2 situations where you'd want to make the blueprint count lower:  

- Your spine joint count is very high (> 8) and you just don't want to take care of so many blueprint joints  
- You want to quickly add more spine joints without having to go into the blueprints

In version 5 the spine got a big update, where the **fkSpline** got those extra features:

- Reverse FK
- preIK in fkSpline (better for performance compared to switching to ikSpline)

update 0: Round Elbow got removed  
update 1: For placing the pivot blueprints (legPrintLFT_ctrl, legOutBLFT_ctrl, legToesLFT_ctrl,…) 
it’s easier to do that in the blueprint skeleton and and build the blueprint rig on top
