# Builder & Puppet

In the **builder** you manage a collection of lots of functions that all together build the character.

And the **puppet** defines the more important controls of the character, such as spine ctrls, arm/leg ctrls, etc.
The puppet generates the blueprints.ma file (guide joints) and the puppet.rig - which then the builder uses to build the rig.
