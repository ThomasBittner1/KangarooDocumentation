# Blend Joints
Those are simple joints that rotate a percentage of the main joints. And they have a lot of
attributes to make them translate or scale based on their parents' rotation

To add one, just specify the joint in the list.

Then after running that function you'll get that joint. And you can adjust its values:

Mirroring and Saving those values can be done with the DEFAULTATTRS options.

    the DEFAULTATTRS thing is a common workflow throughout all the kangaroo tools. Especially when
    we come to the face
