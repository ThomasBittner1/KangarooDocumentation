<div style="text-align: right"> <em>"I worked over 15 years for well known companies around the world that all had their own rigging systems. Each of them had a few pros and lots of cons.
My big dream over these years was to create the one ultimate rigging system that just works properly so that companies won’t have to keep reinventing the wheel again and again.
Kangaroo-Builder is the result of that." <br>
