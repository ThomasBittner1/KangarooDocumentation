## Tweaker Ctrls
Tweaker Ctrls are ctrls that follow your current setup, and then deform the mesh with an additional skinCluster.  

This is done with the **postRefJoints** attribute, the following limbs have it:

 * singleBone    
 * singleTransform    
 * belt
 * spine (fk, ikSpline, simple)

    When you do the face later, in the face functions you can see the sDisplayAttr atttribute on many of the 
    face setup functions
