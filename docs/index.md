<div style="text-align: right"> <em>"I worked over 15 years for well known companies around the world that all had their own rigging systems. Each of them had a few pros and lots of cons.
My big dream over these years was to create the one ultimate rigging system that just works properly so that companies won’t have to keep reinventing the wheel again and again.
Kangaroo Builder is the result of that." <br>

"Kangaroo Builder has been an essential part of our rigging workflow over the past year. It allowed us to streamline a complex pipeline with impressive speed, 
integrating custom workflows into a solid and flexible framework. There’s no comparable rigging toolset on the market right now, which makes Kangaroo Builder truly stand out."  <br>

"We’ve been using the Kangaroo Builder Rig Tool in production for a while, and it’s become a dependable part of our pipeline.
It’s fast, consistent, and intuitive. Once you know the workflow, setting up a clean, animation-friendly rig is straightforward. 
Its modular, non-destructive design gives flexibility to adjust or expand without breaking anything, and the modules work 
for everything from bipeds to complex creatures. 
Deformation quality is solid out of the box, exporting to UE5 is hassle-free, 
and it’s proven reliable for a wide range of production needs." <br>

"As Animation Director of an animated Feature Film I checked the kangaroo rigs in Detail for the production. 
We had  plenty of different Characters and the rigs worked great for each of them! Especially the performance and 
usability were amazing, and I’d be happy to use the same rig system for our next production again! " <br>
