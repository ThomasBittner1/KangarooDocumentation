The best thing to learn about the weightmap tools is by watching the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2GJ6WLeMU0){target="_blank"}  


Weightmap have similar features as skinCluster tools. They can do:  

- **Flood** (first section of the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2GJ6WLeMU0){target="_blank"})
- **Smooth/Average** ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2GJ6WLeMU0&t=0m55s){target="_blank"})
