<div style="text-align: right"> <em>"I worked over 15 years for well known companies around the world that all had their own rigging systems. Each of them had a few pros and lots of cons.
My big dream over these years was to create the one ultimate rigging system that just works properly so that companies won’t have to keep reinventing the wheel again and again.
Kangaroo-Builder is the result of that." <br>

"Kangaroo-Builder has been an essential part of our rigging workflow over the past year. It allowed us to streamline a complex pipeline with impressive speed, 
integrating custom workflows into a solid and flexible framework. There’s no comparable rigging toolset on the market right now, which makes Kangaroo-Builder truly stand out."  <br>

"We’ve been using the Kangaroo Builder Rig Tool in production for quite a while now, and it’s become a dependable part of our rigging pipeline. 
The biggest advantage is the speed and consistency it offers—once you know the workflow, setting up a clean, animation-friendly rig is straightforward and repeatable. 
The interface is intuitive, the guide placement is quick, and the controls it generates are clear, well-structured, and easy for animators to work with.

One thing I’ve always appreciated about Kangaroo is that it’s modular and non-destructive. 
Even though it’s an auto-rigging system, you still have plenty of flexibility to adjust, swap, or expand components without breaking the whole rig.
Over time, we’ve also found that the existing modules are versatile enough to handle not just standard bipeds and quadrupeds,but also more complex creature setups.
With the right combination of its built-in parts, we’ve been able to create multi-limbed rigs, tails, and other creature features without having to step outside the tool or write a completely separate rig.

Deformation quality out of the box is solid, especially with the options for twist joints, squash/stretch, and corrective shapes. 
While we still refine skin weights for hero characters, the base rig is already at a good production standard.
Another major plus is that it works smoothly for both DCC and Unreal Engine workflows—the joint hierarchy is clean, and exporting to UE5 is hassle-free.

After using it on a range of projects, I can say Kangaroo is not just a time-saver—it’s also reliable enough for long-term production use.
It covers a wide range of rigging needs, from simple background characters to fully-featured creatures, all while keeping rigs clean, consistent, and easy to maintain.
